üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Emergency Response System locally.

Prerequisites
Node.js & npm/Yarn: Ensure you have Node.js (LTS version recommended) and a package manager (npm or Yarn) installed.

Node.js Download

Yarn Installation

Python 3.8+:

Python Download

MongoDB:

Local: MongoDB Community Server installed and running.

Cloud (Recommended for production): A MongoDB Atlas account with a free tier cluster.

1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

Install backend dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Ensure you have a requirements.txt file in your backend directory with fastapi, uvicorn[standard], python-dotenv, motor, etc.)

Create a .env file:
In the backend directory, create a file named .env and add your MongoDB connection string and any other necessary backend environment variables.

# backend/.env
MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27107/" # Or your MongoDB Atlas connection string (e.g., "mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/...")
DB_NAME="emergency_db" # Your desired database name
# Add any other backend-specific environment variables here if needed

Note: For a real system, you might also have API keys for external services (e.g., Google Maps Geocoding API for reverse geocoding addresses from coordinates), but these are not required for the core functionality of the Web APIs themselves.

2. Database Seeding (Optional, but Recommended for Demo)
To populate your MongoDB with some initial mock data for incidents and units:

Ensure your MongoDB server is running.

Run the seeding script:

python seed_db.py

(Ensure seed_db.py is present in your backend directory and configured to use your .env variables.)

3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend

Create a .env file:
In the frontend directory, create a file named .env and add the backend URL.

# frontend/.env
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000"
# IMPORTANT: Ensure NO HTTPS=true or similar lines are present in this file.

Install frontend dependencies:

yarn install # or npm install

4. Configure Craco (for Webpack Customizations)
Ensure your craco.config.js is correctly set up in your frontend root directory. This is crucial for handling specific Webpack behaviors, such as suppressing source map warnings.

// frontend/craco.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
    },
    configure: (webpackConfig) => {
      // Rule to ignore problematic source maps (e.g., from @mediapipe)
      webpackConfig.module.rules.push({
        test: /\.js$/,
        enforce: 'pre',
        use: ['source-map-loader'],
        exclude: [
          /node_modules[\\\/]@mediapipe[\\\/]tasks-vision/,
          // Add other problematic modules here if they arise
        ],
      });
      return webpackConfig;
    },
  },
};

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
Start the Backend Server:
Open a new terminal/PowerShell window, navigate to the backend directory, activate your virtual environment, and run:

cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
uvicorn server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

You should see output indicating the server is running on http://0.0.0.0:8000.

Start the Frontend Development Server:
Open another new terminal/PowerShell window, navigate to the frontend directory, and run:

cd frontend
yarn start # or npm start

This will open your application in your default web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.

Access the Application:

Frontend UI: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

Backend API Documentation (Swagger UI): Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/docs

üóÑ API Endpoints

üí° Key Architectural Highlights
Real-time Communication: Utilizes WebSockets for instant updates on unit locations and new incidents, critical for an emergency response system.

Performance-First Design: Backend is built with FastAPI for high throughput and asynchronous operations. Frontend incorporates techniques like requestIdleCallback (Background Tasks API) and efficient 3D rendering with Three.js to maintain 60fps.

Modular & Scalable: Component-based React frontend and a well-structured FastAPI backend allow for easy expansion and maintenance.

Rich User Experience: Emphasis on intuitive interactions, smooth animations (Framer Motion, React Spring), and a visually appealing design (Glassmorphism, Tailwind CSS) to enhance usability during critical operations.

Browser API Integration: Seamlessly integrates core Web APIs to leverage browser capabilities directly for location, network status, and optimized rendering.
